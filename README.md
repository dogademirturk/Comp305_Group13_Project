### How to run the code:
Open Terminal and go to src folder.

Compile: 

javac Main.java

Run: 

java Main.java test1.txt

java Main.java test2.txt




Time Complexity: O(V^3)

Results:

Test1: Most popular person is 0 with 20 occurence

Execution time in milliseconds: 32

Test2: Most popular person is 90 with 14540 occurence

Execution time in milliseconds: 183
